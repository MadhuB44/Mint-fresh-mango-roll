Line a quarters baker sheet with parchment paper and set aside. (A regular sized baking sheet works just fine too!)
Microwave the semi sweet chocolate chips for 1 minute. Let sit for 1 minute, then microwave for an additional minute. Set aside while you prepare the mint chocolate.
Whip the mango cream until you see the fluff.
Combine the mint chocolate chips, butter and whipping cream in a small glass or ceramic bowl. Microwave for 1 minute 30 seconds. Let sit 2 minutes in the microwave, then add an additional 30 seconds. Let sit 1 minute, then add in peppermint extract and green color, if desired. Gently stir until smooth and butter and cream are well incorporated.
Pour mint mixture out onto parchment lined tray. Spread evenly so that the entire surface is about 1/3″ thick. Pour in the mango fluff. 
Gently stir the semi sweet chocolate until smooth. Spread it in lines along the surface of the mint chocolate.
Take a sharp, thin knife and drag it through the chocolates, so that they swirl together. Repeat this several times across the surface of the chocolate until you’re pleased with the look.
Let cool to set. Cut into 1″ squares. Store chilled until ready to serve. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.
